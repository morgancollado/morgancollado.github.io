Technology runs our modern lives. From connecting with family across the world to meeting basic survival needs like aquiring food, technology is the medium through which we navigate this world. I have always been a techy person, always keeping up with the latest developments in hardware and software. This was solidified by working for tech companies like Apple and TaskRabbit. Working to support techonology and its users have motivated me to learn how to build the tools that are used everyday by everyday people. 

I want to leave the world better then I found it. Learning how to code seems to be a way to do this. With how ubiqutous software is in determining one's life course and opportunities, I want to be in a position to inform the creation of those mechaisms to ensure nobody is left behind. Instead of just helping users troubleshoot apps, I want to be able to make those apps. I want to connect with other developers to see what they are building and how I can add to that. I want to chart a course for others to follow to increase economic opportunities for those in my community. Most of all, I want to leave behind a legacy that enriches all those that come in contact with it. I want to make life easier for people through technology and I want to create experiences that suprise and delight.

I am also a deeply curious person who wants to understand fundemtally how things work. I have a passion for learning and challenging myself to grow. Learning to code will satisfy that part of me that is always seeking new knowledge for its own sake. 

I'm so excited to be embarking on this journey.
